# Social Network API

## Description
The purpose and motivation behind this project was to create and API for a social network using express for routing, MongoDB database and Mongoose ODM. I created routes so that you can interact with the database using insomnia and MongoDB compass. These routes allow you to view all the users and their thoughts, create update and delete users and their thoughts, and create and delete reactions and friends.

## Installation
The installations for the project are express, Mongoose, dotenv and nodemon.

## Usage
In order to start the social network api process, you must first put in the information of the database name and url in a environment variable. You can then seed the database by running "npm run seeds". Once this is done you can then run the server by typing "node index.js", and you can test your routes using insomnia as well as use MongoDB compass to view all the information.
